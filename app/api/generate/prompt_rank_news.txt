I gave you a list of news articles, one per line.
Each line starts with the article ID, then the journal name, and finally the article title.
Format:
ID: Journal: Title

I want you to evaluate each article with the pieces of information you have on those criteria :

Scale:
1/5: The event affects a small community or city.
2/5: The event affects a state or similar region.
3/5: The event affects a whole country or large geographical area.
4/5: The event affects multiple countries and can span multiple continents
5/5: The event affects the global worldwide population.

Magnitude:
1/5: The event has a minimal impact on the lives of those affected, causing minor changes or slight improvements.
2/5: The event has a mild impact, causing noticeable but not substantial changes in the lives of those affected.
3/5: The event significantly impacts those affected, introducing substantial improvements or changes in their daily routine or quality of life.
4/5: The event has a major impact on those affected, causing significant changes that have a long-term effect on their lives.
5/5: The event has a profound impact on those affected, significantly altering their life prospects, health, or well-being. The changes might have a lasting effect on their lives.

Potential:
1/5: The event is likely isolated and will probably not lead to bigger events.
2/5: The event may lead to some changes but is unlikely to cause major future events.
3/5: The event could potentially lead to significant events or changes.
4/5: The event is likely to lead to substantial future events or changes.
5/5: The event is highly likely to lead to major future events on a global scale.

Novelty:
1/5: The event is routine or expected.
2/5: The event is slightly unexpected but not entirely uncommon.
3/5: The event is unexpected and not common.
4/5: The event is likely to lead to substantial future events or changes.
5/5: The event is completely unprecedented and highly unexpected.

Reliability:
1/5: The article is primarily speculative or opinion-based, with little to no factual or scientific evidence supporting its claims.
2/5: The article contains some factual information but also includes significant speculation or unverified claims.
3/5: The article is a mix of factual information and analysis or interpretation. Some claims may not be thoroughly verified or universally accepted.
4/5: The article is mostly factual and evidence-based, with only a small portion of analysis or interpretation.
5/5: The article is entirely factual, evidence-based, and supported by multiple reliable sources or rigorous and verified scientific research.

You don't have access to the sources so you have to guess their reliability based on your own knowledge and impressions.

You must format your response as JSON and follow this format and keep the order given in input:
[
    {"id": 5, "scale": 1, "magnitude": 1, "potential": 1, "novelty": 1, "reliability": 1},
    {"id": 3, "scale": 1, "magnitude": 1, "potential": 1, "novelty": 1, "reliability": 1},
    ...
]

The id field of the output must match the id from the articles list I gave you.

If for some reason you cannot scale one of the articles (for example if the article is not correctly named, incomplete, or incoherent), the article JSON item must be :
{"id": 3, "error": "Description of the problem"}
