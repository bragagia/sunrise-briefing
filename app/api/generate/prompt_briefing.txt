I gave you 5 news summary. I want you to write a daily briefing using those news.
You can rewrite them as you want, but keep it as clear as possible and efficient,
while keeping as much information from the source as you can.

Emphasize for each news why it's important. Start the briefing with a greating and end with a closing.
You can order the news by the level of importance you think they have.
